# Personal Project: Stock Portfolio App
This app is designed to facilitate exploring investing. **It does not use real money**. The personal intent for this project was to teach myself to code GUIs and utilize the yfinance python package.

The current version is not complete with a couple new feature implemintations in the works as well as smoothing out some bugs and creating better usability. Currently runs on my computer and can sell/buy shares, but there are still a few bugs leading to some inaccurate numbers. 

If you would like to view my code, most is found in the files noted below:
- stock_portfolio-GUI_v0.0.3-one_function_WIP.ipynb
- Stock_portfolio_functions2.py
- refreshing_portfolio_loading_gifs.py


Features
- Plots of stock share prices over multiple time ranges
- Plots of stock share prices within portfolio over time 
- Professional recommendations for actions for specific stocks (Breaks frequently due to yahoo-finance website and currently broken on app. Working on a solution.)
- Access to information about the company behind the stock
- Access to news articles relevant to the searched stock


Future features
- Top 3 gaining and losing stocks for multiple time ranges
- Plots of entire portfolio performance over time
