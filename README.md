# Personal Project: Stock Portfolio App
This app is designed to facilitate exploring investing. **It does not use real money**. The intent of this project was to teach myself to code GUIs and utilize the yfinance python package.

The current version is not complete with a couple new feature implemintations in the works as well as smoothing out some bugs and creating better usability. Currently runs on my computer and can sell/buy shares, but there are still a few bugs leading to some inaccurate numbers. 


Features
- Plots of stock share prices over multiple time ranges
- Plots of stock share prices within portfolio over time 
- Professional recommendations for actions for specific stocks
- Access to information about the company behind the stock
- Access to news articles relevant to the searched stock


Future features
- Top 3 gaining and losing stocks for multiple time ranges
- Plots of entire portfolio performance over time

Below are screenshots for v0.0.3 (the current files in the repository).
