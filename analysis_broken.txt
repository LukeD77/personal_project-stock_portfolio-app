Unfortunately, the stock analysis retrieval function in the yfinance package is broken. The Yahoo Finance website frequently changes their encryptions, therefore breaking the web scraper. The "Professional Recommendations" part of the app will not be functional until a new version is released, which is automatically detected and downloaded upon launch. The rest of the app should work though!
